## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. CyberBattleSim Installation
- **Issue:** Not available on PyPI
- **Solution:** Installed from GitHub
- **Result:** Package installed as `cyberbattle` (not `cyberbattlesim`)

### 2. Import Fixes
- **File:** `src/environment/cbs_wrapper.py`
- **Change:** `import cyberbattlesim` → `import cyberbattle`
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 3. Manager Agent Observation Dimension
- **File:** `src/agents/manager.py`
- **Change:** `OBS_DIM = 20` → `OBS_DIM = 21`
- **Reason:** Array index out of bounds (4 subgoals + 4 success rates)
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 4. Docker Desktop
- **Issue:** Not running initially
- **Solution:** Auto-started Docker Desktop
- **Status:** ✅ Running

### 5. Neo4j Container
- **Issue:** Not installed
- **Solution:** Pulled and started `neo4j:5.12` container
- **Status:** ✅ Running on ports 7474/7687

### 6. Environment Variables
- **Issue:** `.env` file missing
- **Solution:** Created from `.env.example`
- **Status:** ✅ Configured with Neo4j credentials

### 7. Test Script
- **File:** `tests/test_setup.py`
- **Changes:**
  - Added `load_dotenv()` to load `.env` file
  - Fixed `import cyberbattlesim` → `import cyberbattle`
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Ready Now)
1. **Run longer training sessions:**
   ```powershell
   python scripts/train_auvap.py --use-neo4j --episodes 100
   ```

2. **Explore Neo4j browser:**
   - Open http://localhost:7474
   - Run queries to see the knowledge graph
   - Visualize network topology

3. **Analyze logs:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Content logs/training.log | Select-String "Episode.*complete"
   ```

### Short Term (Next Development Phase)
1. **Complete CyberBattleSim Integration:**
   - Update `cbs_wrapper.py` to use actual CBS environments
   - Test with chain, toyctf, and custom topologies
   - See `CYBERBATTLE_FIX.md` for details

2. **Implement Full Hierarchical Environment:**
   - Create `src/agents/hierarchical_env.py`
   - Wrap Manager-Worker coordination as Gym environment
   - Enable training with SB3 algorithms directly

3. **Add Action Masking with CKG:**
   - Integrate action masker with real CBS actions
   - Query Neo4j for action preconditions
   - Filter invalid actions before selection

### Long Term (Research & Optimization)
1. **Preference Learning:**
   - Implement real preference-based trajectory rewards
   - Replace heuristic trajectory scoring

2. **Advanced Explainability:**
   - Generate detailed episode reports
   - Extract reasoning paths from CKG
   - Create visualizations of attack paths

3. **Multi-Topology Training:**
   - Train on diverse network configurations
   - Transfer learning between topologies
   - Generalization testing

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Works Well
1. **Modular Design:** Easy to test components independently
2. **Mock Environment:** Can develop/test without full dependencies
3. **Docker Integration:** Neo4j setup is straightforward
4. **Hierarchical RL:** Manager-Worker pattern is functional

### What Needs Attention
1. **CyberBattleSim API:** Different from expected (docs needed)
2. **Environment Wrappers:** Need updating for real CBS usage
3. **Gym vs Gymnasium:** Consider migrating to maintained package

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Docker Not Running
```powershell
# Start Docker Desktop
Start-Process "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe"

# Wait and verify
Start-Sleep -Seconds 15
docker version
```

### Neo4j Connection Failed
```powershell
# Check container status
docker ps --filter name=auvap-neo4j

# Restart if needed
docker restart auvap-neo4j

# Check logs
docker logs auvap-neo4j
```

### Python Import Errors
```powershell
# Verify virtual environment is active
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.13.7

# Reinstall if needed
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Test Verification Fails
```powershell
# Run full verification
python tests/test_setup.py

# Check specific component
python -c "from src.agents import ManagerAgent; print('✓ OK')"
```
