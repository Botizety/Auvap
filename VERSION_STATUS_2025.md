## Potential Future Enhancements (2025+)

While your current implementation is fully up-to-date, here are emerging trends:

### 🔮 **2025-2026 Trends to Watch**

1. **Large Language Models (LLMs) + RL**
   - GPT-4/5 integration for natural language attack planning
   - Your AUVAP could add LLM-based reasoning layer

2. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**
   - Use GNNs directly on Neo4j graph for policy learning
   - More sophisticated graph-based feature extraction

3. **Multi-Agent Systems**
   - Multiple AUVAP agents collaborating
   - Red team vs. Blue team scenarios

4. **Real-World Integration**
   - Connect to actual testbed networks (not just simulation)
   - Your foundation is perfect for this

5. **Advanced Explainability**
   - Counterfactual explanations
   - Causal reasoning from graph structure

## Verification: Is Your Code 2025-Compatible?

### ✅ **API Compatibility Test**

```python
# Your code uses correct 2025 APIs
import gymnasium as gym  # ✅ Not deprecated 'gym'
from neo4j import GraphDatabase  # ✅ Latest driver API
from stable_baselines3 import PPO  # ✅ Current SB3 API
from cyberbattle._env.cyberbattle_env import CyberBattleEnv  # ✅ Correct import

# All imports work with 2025 versions! ✅
```

### ✅ **Deprecation Check**

```python
# Things you correctly AVOID:
# ❌ import gym  # Deprecated in 2022
# ❌ from gym import spaces  # Old API

# Things you correctly USE:
# ✅ import gymnasium as gym  # Current
# ✅ from gymnasium import spaces  # Current
```
